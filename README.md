Bank Loan Analysis Dashboard: An End-to-End Project with  Power BI
This project outlines the development of a comprehensive bank loan analysis dashboard  followed by data visualization in Power BI.

Project Overview
Financial institutions require a robust system to analyze their loan portfolio performance, identify trends, and make informed decisions. This project delivers a data-driven solution by leveraging the combined strengths of  Power BI.

Workflow:

Data Visualization and Exploration: Import the data into Power BI and transform the data according to requirements to create interactive dashboards that visually represent key insights and trends.
Key Features
Consolidated Data Storage: Maintain a centralized and secure data repository for all bank loan information . 
KPIs at a Glance: Gain immediate insights into loan portfolio health through key performance indicators (KPIs) displayed in the Power BI dashboards.
Trend Analysis: Analyze trends over time by visualizing loan applications, approvals, repayments, and other loan characteristics within Power BI.
Granular Loan Details: Explore individual loan information in Power BI through interactive dashboards, allowing for focused analysis of specific loan attributes.
Interactive Filtering: Leverage filters and slicers within Power BI dashboards to refine your analysis by loan term, purpose, employee tenure, application date, or other relevant data points.
Tools and Technologies

Microsoft Power BI: This business intelligence tool serves as the primary platform for building and deploying the interactive dashboards for data visualization and exploration.
Data Requirements
The project requires a dataset containing comprehensive bank loan information. Below is the description ofthe attributes - **

Dashboard Design and Development: Create interactive dashboards in Power BI that effectively visualize KPIs, trends, and loan details using measures and new tables using DAX queries.
Testing and Refinement: Test the dashboards for functionality, usability, and visual appeal. Refine and iterate on the design based on user feedback.
